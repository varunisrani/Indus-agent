# Usage log — Agent 1 (Account 1)

Agent 1 usage is the five-hour window's utilization on Account 1, read from this session's own
rate-limit events. Readings lag a few minutes, so 88 % counts as 90 %. Times in UTC.
Only Agent 1 writes this file: one row per check, appended, never edited. Agent 2 keeps
`usage-log-agent-2.md`.
